Which author are you? program

This is a simple interactive program that uses basic machine learning fundamentals. It imports text from a 6 classic artists and the computer then learns how the author writes, learning off a majority of the data. Then, the computer can then use the sections of the data that it was NOT learning from to decipher which author wrote it, with quite accurate results. 

Latest added feature: the ability to type your own work, and the machine will tell you which of our classic authors you write the most like.
